In this tutorial, I will be going over on how to install the modpack for TEDS SMP Season 2!


## Vanilla launcher

If you use the vanilla launcher, you will follow these steps!
1. Make sure to have run 1.19.2 once to ensure game files have been installed
2. Download [Quilt Loader](https://maven.quiltmc.org/repository/release/org/quiltmc/quilt-installer/0.5.0/quilt-installer-0.5.0.jar) ([backup if you can't run the installer](https://maven.quiltmc.org/repository/release/org/quiltmc/quilt-installer-native-bootstrap/windows-x86_64/0.5.0/windows-x86_64-0.5.0.exe))
3. Install Quilt loader 0.18.10 for Minecraft 1.19.2
4. Download TEDS Plus Installer (yes, I know, but works for the server)
   - [Windows](https://github.com/DovydasTEDS/teds-plus-installer/releases/download/v1.0.0/teds-plus-installer_1.0.0_amd64.deb.msi)(yes, file name is a bit messed up)
   - [MacOS](https://github.com/DovydasTEDS/teds-plus-installer/releases/download/v1.0.0/TEDS.Plus.Installer_1.0.0_x64_macOS.dmg)
   - [Linux](https://github.com/DovydasTEDS/teds-plus-installer/releases/download/v1.0.0/TEDS.Plus.Installer_1.0.0_x64_Windows.msi.deb)(yes, file name is a bit messed up)
5. Install the installer (yes, odd)
6. Run the installer and select TEDS SMP S2
7. Click "Install" -> "Continue" -> "Install"
8. If you are stuck at 0%, please use a different launcher as I might have broken a part

## Any other launcher

If your launcher of choice supports .mrpack files, you are in luck!
Click [this](https://cdn.tedps.tk/teds_smp_s2-2.1.0.mrpack) to download the .mrpack and install it. For Prism Launcher you can just run the file I think.
