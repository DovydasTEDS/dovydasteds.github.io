In this tutorial, I will be going over on how to install TEDS Plus!


## Vanilla launcher

If you use the vanilla launcher, you will follow these steps!
1. Make sure to have run the version of TEDS Plus you are installing once to ensure game files have been installed
2. Download TEDS Plus Installer
   - [Windows](https://github.com/DovydasTEDS/teds-plus-installer/releases/download/v1.0.0/teds-plus-installer_1.0.0_amd64.deb.msi)(yes, file name is a bit messed up)
   - [MacOS](https://github.com/DovydasTEDS/teds-plus-installer/releases/download/v1.0.0/TEDS.Plus.Installer_1.0.0_x64_macOS.dmg)
   - [Linux](https://github.com/DovydasTEDS/teds-plus-installer/releases/download/v1.0.0/TEDS.Plus.Installer_1.0.0_x64_Windows.msi.deb)(yes, file name is a bit messed up)
3. Install the installer (yes, odd)
4. Run the installer and select the TEDS Plus version you want
5. Click "Install" -> "Continue" -> "Install"
6. If you are stuck at 0%, please use a different launcher as I might have broken a part
