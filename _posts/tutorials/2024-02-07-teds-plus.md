TEDS Plus is a Minecraft modpack that runs on the fabric loader.  
It includes many optimisation mods including Sodium, Lithium and Starlight.  

TEDS Plus comes in 2 versions:

- TEDS Plus
- TEDS Lite  

TEDS Lite is a version of TEDS Plus with a reduced mod list, leaving only the needed mods.  
This provides more performance than TEDS Plus.  
  
## How to Install
TEDS Plus can be installed on a variety of launchers.  
Any launcher that supports Modrinth and / or .mrpack files is recommended.
These include:

- [Modrinth Launcher](https://modrinth.com/app)
- [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/)
- [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/#Download)
- [GDLauncher](https://gdlauncher.com/) (As of writing, only the Beta supports Modrinth, which can be found in the [Discord](https://discord.gdlauncher.com/))
- [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/)
- [QuestCraft](https://questcraft.org/) (for VR on Oculus Quest)
  
However, most people still use the vanilla launcher, which I highly recommend to not use.

### Vanilla Launcher

1. Install JRE  
   You can do this by downloading a JRE and installing it. I recommend Adoptium:
   - [Windows](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17&package=jre&arch=x64&os=windows)
   - [MacOS](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17&package=jre&arch=x64&os=mac)
   - For Linux, what the hell are you doing here.
2. Download [TEDS Plus Installer](https://github.com/TeamTEDS/teds-plus-installer/releases/latest)  
   You can do this by downloading the Universal Jar from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/TeamTEDS/teds-plus-installer/releases/latest) (I recommend the Universal .jar even for Windows)  Downloading the .jar avoids you needing to restart your system to set the path.
3. Install  
   Run the .jar file. If you check the box at the top, you will install TEDS Plus.  
   If the checkbox is unticked, you will install TEDS Lite.  
   Then choose your Minecraft version you want. It is not recommended to enable unsupported versions.  
   The latest version of the modpack for that version should be selected. If you want an older version, you can select it in the second selection box.  
   If you want, you can set the install location of TEDS Plus / TEDS Lite. This is useful for people who use another drive.  
   Finally, hit Install.
4. Launch  
   Open the vanilla Minecraft Launcher and select your TEDS Plus / TEDS Lite version you installed and hit play!

### Modrinth Launcher

Modrinth Launcher is what I recommend for beginners. You can get the install from the [Modrinth website](https://modrinth.com/app).  
After installing the launcher, hit the search box and search for TEDS Plus / TEDS Lite.

### Other Launchers

For MulitMC based launchers (including Prism Launcher), click add instance.  
Then select Modrinth and search for TEDS Plus / TEDS Lite.  
  
For unmentioned launchers, look for modrinth and search for TEDS Plus / TEDS Lite.  
If you cannot install TEDS Plus, consult your launcher's documentation on how to install modpacks from modrinth or a .mrpack file.

### .mrpack

.mrpack is a file format for modpacks packaged for Modrinth.  
You can find this by visiting the [TEDS Plus](https://modrinth.com/modpack/teds-plus) / [TEDS Lite](https://modrinth.com/modpack/teds-plus) Modrinth pages.  
You can then download one of the supported / maintained versions on the page or click on the versions tab for more versions.  
In your launcher, look for a place to import from a file. Ensure that it supports .mrpack files.  
After you install the modpack, you can then run it.
