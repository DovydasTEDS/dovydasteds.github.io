Hello there. If you are thinking "wow. what a cool site!" then you would be interested in this page.
This website was created using jekyll and GitHub pages. It uses the Moonwalk theme but has been customised with these cool colours (red).
If you want to try make a cool site too, you can fork a template on github, setup pages and customise it to your liking! Hope you enjoyed this post.
